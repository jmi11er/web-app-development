                            I worked on this project alone, and relied heavily on public databases that I could trim and manipulate in Microsoft Excel.

                            I had to take a spreadsheet of EVERY Congressional race since 1976's votal totals and edit to just include the winners' share of the vote.

                <strong>How it works</strong><br>
                The first part of the article, pictured left, offers readers a summary of where Congress stands today. From there, I tried to show that there is a connection between how close a Congressman came to losing and how they behave in Congress. I used two measures: ideology
                and party loyalty. In both cases. vulnerable Democrats were more likely to moderate themselves and stay loyal to the party than Republicans. Finally, I looked at how similar Congressmen behaved after the <em>election</em>, to see who survived and who learned any lessons.
