                        This project was assigned as the first homework for Web Application Development, which is a 2000-level CS elective.

                        I worked on this project alone and had to learn HTML for the first time to do so.

                        The website, published to GitHub, is the only material in this project, although it contains plenty of pictures and information from other classes' projects.

                <strong>How it works</strong><br>
                I have never used HTMl before, so this process involved some trial and error. I had to make a main page as well as three sub-page with information about projects I have worked on. I also had to implement some personal information, which was honestly a bit of a stretch because I don't have that much interesting happening right now.
                I was hoping to include videos for some of these projects, but I was unable to get those to embed correctly after multiple attempts. This project also contains a lot of links to sections and other pages, which was useful and suprinsingly simple. Overall, I didn't think HTML would be this easy to pick up.
