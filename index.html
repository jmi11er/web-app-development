                    <br><br><strong>Personal Bio</strong><br>
                    I was born in Washington, D.C., and lived nearby until I was 8, when my family moved
                    to South Jersey, where we still live. <br><br>At BC, I work for <em>The Heights</em>, the independent student
                    newspaper. I used to be the news editor, and I more recently have taken a position as a senior staff writer.
                    <br><br> My interests include U.S. politics, journalism, and elections.

                    I have worked at <em>The Heights</em> as an editor since my second semester as a freshmen, when I joined as the associate investigative editor. 
                    In that role, I managed some lower-level weekly duties, such as maintining some social media accounts and doing some basic administrative tasks, in addition to long-term investigative or special projects.

                    I am taking several computer science classes this semester, including Data Science, Web Application Development, and Prinicples of Programming Languages. 
                    I am looking foward to tackling more advanced topics now that I am done the major's required courses such as Computer Systems. 
                    In addition to those classes, I am finishing up my political science degree this semester.

                        I am drafting a portfolio website for my web application development class. The task involves some basic HTML, which I have never used before. If you're a fan of recursion, check out the link <a href="portfolio_details.html">here</a> for more information!

                        I analyzed how margin of victory predicted the behavior of members of the United States House of Representatives.
                        I then took a look back at the patterns of previous Congresses to speculate on where the 2020 elections might lead the country. <a href="dj.html">Click here for more information</a>.

                        The final project for my Computer Organization class last semester required us to work in Verilog to create a program of our choice with a hardware component. 
                        My partner and I decided to make a clock that incemented a counter with some special functionality. <a href="counter.html">Find out more here</a>.
