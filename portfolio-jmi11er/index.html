                        <strong>Personal Bio</strong><br>
                        I was born in Washington, D.C., and lived nearby until I was 8, when my family moved
                        to South Jersey, where we still live. <br>At BC, I work for <em>The Heights</em>, the independent student
                        newspaper. I used to be the news editor, and I more recently have taken a position as a senior staff writer.

                            I have recently applied to work at BC's new Writing Center, which is located in Stokes. 
                            I'm looking foward to be helping students develop their writing skills, especially at BC, where writing is so emphasized.

                           <strong> Making the move to senior staff</strong><br>
                           I have worked at <em>The Heights</em> as an editor since my second semester as a freshmen, when I joined as the associate investigative editor. 
                           In that role, I managed some lower-level weekly duties, such as maintining some social media accounts and doing some basic administrative tasks, in addition to long-term investigative or special projects. 
                           I soon moved on to the news section, where I served as assistant, associate, and head news editor. As head news, I was responsible for our staff writers (about two dozen) as well as finding and managing articles to fill the paper each week. 
                           Now, I have stepped down from the board to write more as senior staff.

                            I am taking several computer science classes this semester, including Data Science, Web Application Development, and Prinicples of Programming Languages. 
                            I am looking foward to tackling more advanced topics now that I am done the major's required courses such as Computer Systems. 
                            In addition to those classes, I am finishing up my political science degree this semester.

                        I am drafting a portfolio website for my web application development class. The task involves some basic HTML, which I have never used before. If you're a fan of recursion, check out the link here <a href="portfolio_details.html">here</a> for more information!

                        For my Data Journalism course last semeter, I decided to draw on my interest in political science and analyze how margin of victory predicted the behavior of members of the United States House of Representatives.
                        I then took a look back at the patterns of previous Congresses to speculate on where the 2020 elections might lead the country. <a href="dj.html">Click here for more information</a>.

                        The final project for my Computer Organization class last semester required us to work in Verilog to create a program of our choice with a hardware component. 
                        My partner and I decided to make a clock that incemented a counter with some special functionality. <a href="counter.html">Find out more here</a>.
